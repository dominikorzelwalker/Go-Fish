# Go-Fish Game

This project allows you to play the game of Go Fish against a computer bot!

*gofish_game_random.py* puts you up against a computer bot which plays a random strategy, i.e. from the set of card ranks it holds it will select one of these at random to ask for.

*gofish_game_Qlearning.py* puts you up against a computer bot which employs a Q-Learning algorithm to make decisions, optimising its strategy over time. The more you play against it the better it'll become, so good luck!
